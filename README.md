# Backend - Portal Game
This project shows you how to create a backend for an Unity 3D game based on
Java EE 6 technologies. The backend is exposed over REST.


Running in Cloudbees > http://portalgame.sdmoralesma.cloudbees.net/portal/WebPlayer.html

(**Disclosures : The app takes a couple of minutes to wake up. You could receive an http error or see the glassfish page, so, stay calm and try again!, aditionally the game only works in windows machines (because of the Unity webplayer)**).
